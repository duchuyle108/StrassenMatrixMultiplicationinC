# Strassen's Algorithm of Matrix Multiplication in C
An implementation of Strassen's algorithm of matrix-matrix multiplication in C.
## What is this project?
In this project, I implemented the algorithm, made several serial code optimizations and parallelize the program. A few key concepts:

- Morton Ordering (Z-ordering)
- Data Locality
- OpenMP
